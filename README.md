==========

Get random geeky comic strips from web.

geekComics is a small shell script to fetch random comic strips. As of now it gets its strips from
  <br>- xkcd
  <br>- Cyanide & Happiness
  <br>- PhD Comics
  <br>- Garfield 
  <br>- Abstruse Goose

USAGE :
	./geekComic.sh [COMIC INDEX FROM 0-9]
 
You can edit .bashrc to run this script everytime you open a new terminal.

It stores the images in $HOME/Pictures/GEEK_COMIC and if any image already exists in the directory, it displays it without downloading again.

Have fun. Any suggestions are welcome.
